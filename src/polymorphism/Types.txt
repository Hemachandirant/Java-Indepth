1.Compile time polymorphism - Static 	polymorphism
Acheived by Method overloading  ( In a same class, methods with same name but different parameters)

2. Runtime polymorphism - Dynamic polymorphism
Acheived by method overriding (In a different class. methods with same name but differnet parameters)


Final keyword -- use to restrict a method or variable to be redefined
If we create a class to final, implicitly all the methods present in the class is final

Static - Cannot depend on Object and called by using class

Static methods can be inherited but cannot be overridden
