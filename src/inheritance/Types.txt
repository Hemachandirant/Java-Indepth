1. Single inheritance
Class A -> Class B
2. Multilevel inheritance
Class A -> Class B -> Class C
3. Multiple inheritance
(Not supported in Java) due to multiambiguity problem
Class A     Class B
  |             |
  |             |
  |____Class C__|    
4. Hierarchical inheritance

Class A  --> class B
      |-----> Class C
      |-----> Class D
5. Hybrid inheritance
   Combination of single and multiple iheritance , due to multiple inheritace is not present in java so hybrid is 
   not supported
